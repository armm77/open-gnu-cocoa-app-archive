<UL>
  <LI>None
</UL>
<H4> Corrections </H4>
<UL>
  <LI>Fixed a problem that CVL was not parsing the .cvspass file correctly when encountering the new cvs format where the entries start with a slash. These entries had a port number in them and that was not being handled correctly.
  <LI>There was code that was checking for a repository access method of remote which is no longer being used. Removed this code.
  <LI>Other minor corrections.
</UL>
<H4> Changes </H4>
<UL>

<H4>New features</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Added a new easier way of entering date and time when requesting a checkout based on date or when asking for a file restore, a file replacement or a file difference when based on a date.
  <LI> Added a "Check for Updates" feature.
  <LI>The CVS compression level is now specified per repository instead of one value for all repositories. 
  <LI>Changed the behavior of the status of folders to show a star (i.e. not in CVS) status when the folder is already added to the repositiory and has new files in it or any of its sub-folders. The old behavior showed these folders with a plus (i.e. modified). This behavior was the one CVL had prior to version 3.0.1v31.
  <LI>The CVL browser viewer can now perform a right-size operation; that is, double clicking the column resize icon will size a column to the smallest width that contains all the content without clipping or truncating. Double clicking again will restore the column to its previous size.

  <LI>In cvs 1.12.9, the date format in 'cvs log' output has changed from 'yyyy/mm/dd' to 'yyyy-mm-dd'. CVL will now handle this. 
  <LI>Fixed an out-of-bounds exception which was occurring when displaying the environment table view while changing from a repository with more environment variables to one with less.

<UL>
<LI> (Windows version) Services don't work if CVL is not running.
<LI> Open Differences does not work for conflicts obtained when merging across branches.
<LI> (Windows version) Restoring a version of a wrapper directory does not work. Restored file is in fact a .gtar.gz file. Workaround: unarchive it before using it.
<LI> (Windows version) A user recently reported that if you're using Windows NT 4 SP4 you may encounter severe slowness using cvs, hence CVL; cvs reports "connection timeout" errors. This problem is due to Service Pack 4. You should try to update to SP5 or later if you have this problem.
<LI> (WebObjects 4.5 only) ProjectBuilder crashes if PBFilenamePasteboardFix bundle is loaded.
<LI> (Windows and MacOS X Server Rhapsody only) CVL provides a <B>Select in CVL</B> service to any application capable of selecting files.
