CVL Build
=========

CVL depends on three SenFrameworks, and must be distributed as a stand-alone application which contains frameworks in the app wrapper.
CVS modules: Cocoa/SenFoundation, Cocoa/OCUnit/SenTestingKit, Cocoa/Oyster/SenOyster, Cocoa/CVLLauncher, CVL

For distribution:
-----------------
Default install path (DSTROOT) is $HOME. If you want to modify it, add DSTROOT=/my/root/path in Build Options/Arguments.
First, remove SenFoundation.framework, SenTestingKit.framework and SenOyster.framework from ~/Library/Frameworks (on NT, do not forget ~/Library/Executables; also delete perl.dll and cw3230mt.dll)
Perform a build <install> on SenFoundation.framework, then SenTestingKit.framework, and finally SenOyster.framework; default install will put frameworks in ~/Library/Frameworks (on NT, also in ~/Library/Executables)
Perform a build <install> on CVL; default install will put application in ~/Applications
Perform a build <install> on CVLLauncher; it will create in ~/Applications/CVLLauncher the final CVL.app containing all frameworks. It copies frameworks from ~/Library/Frameworks (on NT, also ~/Library/Executables), application from ~/Applications, and put all this stuff in a newly created wrapper, ~/Applications/CVLLauncher/CVL.app.

For development:
----------------
For development, you don't need to create a full wrapper; if frameworks are installed in ~/Library/Frameworks, you don't need to compile the CVLLauncher; simply compiling CVL (in app, debug, install, etc.) is enough.
