<h2>Dragging</h2>
Alt-Dragging selects a square area.  Shift-Dragging steps 4 pixels at one time.
<br>
Dragging in the selected area moves the area itself.
<p>
Size and position of selected area are displayed in the textfield of each window.  You can set the origin of the coordinate at lower left corner or at upper left corner of the image with the preference.
<p>
In order to cancel selection, do single click on the image.
<p>
Command-Dragging moves (scrolls) the image.
<p>

<h2>Transparent Color</h2>
ToyViewer can read/write tiff, pdf, eps, gif, or png files with transparent color.
<br>
Transparent parts are displayed in white or black.  You can select white or black with the preference.  But, transparent parts of PDF or EPS is always displayed in white.
<br>
If you double-click, triple-click, or quadruple-click the image, the transparent parts are displayed in white, gray or black.  So, you can know where the transparent parts are.
<p>


<h2>Position of Windows</h2>
There are two ways to display newly opened window.  One is to open windows at various position (Auto), and the other is to open new window over the main window (Fix).  You can choose the way to display windows with the preference.  You can also choose third way in which Fix method is used only when a folder is auto-scanned.
<p>
Large windows are displayed up to the edge of the screen.  But, they often obstruct the operation to the Dock.  You can specify margin to left, right, and bottom edges of the screen, where windows are not displayed.
<p>


<h2>Display All Window</h2>
If you click "Windows / Display All Windows" of the menu, all windows are displayed in front one after another.  Click the menu again to interrupt.
<br>
Interval time is set by the preference panel.
<p>

<h2>Display Previous/Next Window</h2>
With "Windows / Display Next Window", or "Windows / Display Previous Window" (Cmd-0, Cmd-9) of the menu, next or previous window is sent front.  Combination of Fix mode described in "Position of Windows" and this facility could be convenient to compare two images.
<p>

<h2>Display in Front-Mode</h2>
If you click the zoom button of the window, or if you select "Windows / Display in Front-Mode" of the menu, the main window is displayed in front of all other windows.  If the image is larger than the screen, it would be displayed in full-screen.  This style of display is called "Front-Mode".
<p>
When more than one images are displayed, the current main window is displayed in front of all other windows.  Dragging on the window would move the image displayed; you can not select area.
<p>
In order to cancel Front-Mode, double-click the main window, or type Cmd-Alt-Z.  Or, if all windows are closed, Front-Mode is automatically canceled.
<p>

<h2>Edit Comment</h2>
Some images have comments written in the files.  ToyViewer can read such comments, and display them in the text areas of windows.  Though small windows can not display long text, if you keep the mouse cursor on the text area, the comment will be displayed as "Tool Tips".
<p>
If you click "Tools / Inspector..." of the menu, a panel is displayed.  You can add or edit the comment on the image with this panel.
<br>
The comment specified here will be saved with the image data if the format in which the image is saved is gif, png, jpg, or pnm.
