<h2>Clip</h2>
You can select a part of the image by dragging.  Selected area can be clipped by "Operation / Clip" (Cmd-Opt-C) of the menu.  Clipped images are displayed on newly opened windows.
<p>

<h3>Clipping and Copy</h3>
You can `copy' a part of the image selected by dragging as a tiff image.  However, resolution and number of colors of the image depend on the environment.
<br>
Clipped image keeps same quality as original.
<p>

<h3>Clipping of PDF/EPS</h3>
ToyViewer can not clip PDF images.
<p>
Clipping an EPS image, only parameters of `BoundingBox' of the image are modified.  So, all information out of the frame is still in the image file.
<br>
Current version of Mac OS X (10.1.5) does not display EPS images.
<p>


<h2>Rotate / Flip</h2>

<h2>Resize</h2>
</a>
Clicking the item "Operation / Resize..." of the menu, you can display the tool panel to make resized images.

<br>
When you resize a PDF/EPS image, newly created images are always smooth.  So, don't care about "DCT" or "Bilinear" .
<br>
When you shrink a bitmap image, as "DCT" is applied automatically, only pre-defined magnifications can be selected.  Removing check from "Auto Select" and selecting "Bilinear", you can specify any magnification.  Both of them can make resized images keeping good quality for pictorial images.  But, for palettized or bilevel images, DCT would be recommended. 
<br>
When you enlarge a bitmap image, use "Bilinear" method.  Any magnification could be used.
