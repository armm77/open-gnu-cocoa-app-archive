<h2>Scan Images in a Folder</h2>
Clicking "File / Scan Folder" of the menu, you can select a folder to scan image files in it.  Image files are displayed automatically using a control panel.
<br>
Folder that includes image files can also be selected by dragging its icon onto the icon of ToyViewer in the Dock.
<br>
But, if there are only a few files in the folder, control panel does not appear and these files are displayed normally.
<br>
In order to start auto-display, click "Start" button of the panel.  Then, image files in the folder displayed automatically at regular intervals.  "Pause" button stops auto-display, and you can chose the image file with the slider on the panel.  Interval time is set by the preference panel.
<p>
As new images are displayed, windows of previous images are closed automatically.  But, windows whose remark button is checked are not closed automatically.
<p>


<h2>Display Images on Full-Screen</h2>
While scanning a folder, as described in the previous section, you can display images on full-screen.  Check "Full-Screen" button, and then push "Start" or "Step" button.  The way to display the image is specified by the popup menu; Tiling, Brick Work, Centering, Fit to the Screen, or Cover the Screen.
<p>
The shape of the mouse cursor changes according to its position.  On the right side of the screen, it becomes a right arrow.  Similarly, it becomes a left arrow on the left side.  While auto-play is going on, mouse click changes the play mode to step mode.  During step mode, mouse click displays next image or previous image correspondingly.  In the upper right area of the screen, the shape of the mouse cursor represents "Pause".  During auto-play, mouse click in this area changes the play mode to step mode.  During step mode, mouse click quits full-screen displaying.  Therefore, in order to quit full-screen auto-playing, click twice in the upper right area.
<p>
Keyboard operation is also available.
<ul>
<li> Forward: f, n, Space, Return, Tab, RightArrow
<li> Backward: b, p, BackSpace, Delete, LeftArrow
<li> Pause: q, Escape
</ul>
